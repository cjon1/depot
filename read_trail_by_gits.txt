If I've got this correct, I've managed to balls up by creating my first_app repository with:

a) bobbins name (copied Josh's clone email syntax thru niavety but it wasn't appropriate here)

b) I have managed to get it to default to using ssh when doing e.g. 'git push'

The depot repository seems far better bcos x) name isn't bobs y) it was easier to create the repository z)'git push' works as is with no grief.
